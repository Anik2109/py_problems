# Python Math and Matrix Operations

This repository contains Python functions to perform various mathematical and matrix operations. The code is implemented both as a Python script (`.py` file) and in a Jupyter Notebook for interactive use.

## **Features**

### **Mathematical Operations**
1. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   Generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **HCF (Highest Common Factor)**  
   Compute the HCF of two numbers.

3. **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**  
   Identical to HCF, as per the mathematical definition.

4. **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**  
   Compute the LCM of two numbers using the relationship:  
   \[ \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{HCF}(a, b)} \]

### **Matrix Operations**
5. **Add Two Matrices**  
   Add two matrices of the same dimensions element-wise.

6. **Transpose a Matrix**  
   Compute the transpose of a matrix.

7. **Multiply Two Matrices**  
   Multiply two matrices using the standard row-column dot product method.
